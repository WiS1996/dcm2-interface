# matelect-dcm2-interface

The software provided by the manufacturer is insufficient for my needs and a specific bug makes it incompatible with my workflow. This will be an attempt to create an Interface that suits my needs.

Goals:
-   define settings from the interface
-   receive measurement data from the device
-   display current data
-   graphical display of historic data
-   log data to a file
-   interface with test software
